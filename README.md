# BYUI DS Portfolio Template
## Building a Quarto Portfolo

A template for a portfolio developed with Quarto and hosted on GitHub.

This is all configured so you only need to edit the source files in Quarto (.qmd). The website is generated and hosted automatically by GitHub.

## Using this template

1. Click on green button "Use this Tempalte" -> "Create a new Repo"

1. Choose a name for your repository

1. Important: check 'Include all branches' when creating the repository (because we will need the gh-pages branch to host the website).

1. Once your repo is created: 

    a. Open your settings in GitHub, navigate to the `Pages` section of settings on the left hand side, and make sure the branch is `gh-pages` and the folder is `/(root)`.
    a. Then navigate to `Collaborators and teams`, click the green button `Add teams` and search for your techer and the current semester team, then add them.
    a. Remember to update the links to your GitHub repo in _quarto.yml, replacing every instance 'your_name'.

1. The first time you publish to your repo use GitHub Desktop and `Commit` all your files then `Push` them.
